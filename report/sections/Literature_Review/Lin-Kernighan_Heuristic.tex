\subsection{Lin-Kernighan Heuristic}
To be able to efficiently solve many TSPs, to find a good estimate for $\beta$, a fast and reliable
solution algorithm is needed. The Lin-Kernighan \citep{lin1973effective} heuristic provides outcome,
it is generally considered to be one of the most effective methods of generating (near) optimal
solutions for the TSP.
In this research a modified implementation of the heuristic is used \citep{helsgaun2000effective}.
The run times of both heuristics increase by approximately $n^{2.2}$, but the modified heuristic is
much more effective. It is able to find optimal solutions to large instances in reasonable times
\citep{helsgaun2000effective}.
