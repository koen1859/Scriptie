	abstract = "The shortest tour distance for visiting all points exactly once
	            and returning to the origin is computed by solving the well-known
	            traveling salesman problem (TSP). Owing to the large computational
	            effort needed for optimizing TSP tours, researchers have developed
	            approximations that relate the average length of TSP tours to the
	            number of points, n, visited per tour. The existing approximations
	            are used in transportation system planning and evaluation for
	            estimating the distance for vehicles with large capacities (e.g.,
	            delivery trucks) where n is relatively large. However, the average
	            TSP tour lengths would be inaccurately estimated if the
	            approximations were derived for a wide range of n values since the
	            tour lengths increase at a decreasing rate (i.e., with n) as n
	            increases. A comprehensive review is presented here of existing
	            studies approximating TSP tour lengths for low n values, which have
	            become important for some recently favored delivery alternatives
	            (e.g., deliveries by bikes, drones, and robots).",
