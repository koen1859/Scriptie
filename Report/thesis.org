* Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem is an important problem in operations research.
It is particularly relevant for last-mile carriers and other logistics companies where efficient
routing directly impacts cost, time and service quality. Since the number of parcels worldwide has
increased between 2013 and 2022 and is expected to keep increasing [cite:statista], the need for
fast, scalable route planning methods becomes ever more pressing.

The TSP is an NP-hard problem, it is computationally intensive to find the exact solution for
large instances. In many real-world scenarios, companies may not need the exact routes for deliveries,
but instead require rough, reliable estimates. For instance a last-mile carrier or a food delivery
chain expanding to a new area. Then this firm may only know what area they will serve and have
some estimates of how many customers they will get. In such cases, they may need quick answers to
questions like how many vehicles and personnel they will need.

Efficient approximation methods provide a solution for such practical applications where exact
solutions are too computationally intensive to conduct or not feasible due to insufficient data.
These methods aim at approximating the expected optimal total travel time or distance, while using
minimal data and computational effort.

There is extensive research on such approximation methods and how they perform in the euclidean
plane.
Consider $n$ uniformly drawn locations inside some area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with area $A$.

as an estimation for the length of the shortest TSP path measured by Euclidean distance through
these random locations, where $\beta$ is some proportionality constant. This formula is a very
elegant result, approximation and it requires very little data. However, its assumptions,
uniform random locations and euclidean space differ from real-world applications, which are defined
by complex geographic features, such as road networks.

This research investigates how well this approximation method performs when we consider real road
networks. Using OpenStreetMap data, we simulate TSP instances in a selection of different areas
in the Netherlands, then solve these for the actual shortest paths using the Linâ€“Kernighan heuristic.
Then we estimate $\beta$ from from equation \ref{eq:beardwood} and analyze the performance of this
formula. Additionally, we compare the results for $\beta$ and the performance across the selected
areas, with the goal of understanding the driving factors behind the varying results.

In section 2 we dive deeper in the context and previous research in this field. Then, in section 3
we show the methodology ...
